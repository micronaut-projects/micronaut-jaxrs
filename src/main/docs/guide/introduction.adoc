Micronaut JAX-RS adds support for using JAX-RS annotations and types in a Micronaut application with the aim of helping migrate existing JAX-RS applications or support teams who prefer the JAX-RS annotations.

This project is not an implementation of the JAX-RS specification and is designed to allow users familiar with the JAX-RS API to use the most common parts of the API within the context of a Micronaut application.

TIP: See the guide for https://guides.micronaut.io/latest/micronaut-jaxrs-jdbc.html[Micronaut JAX-RS] to learn more.
