As of this writing Micronaut JAX-RS supports the annotations and types defined within the `javax.ws.rs` package and the `javax.ws.rs.core` subpackage only.

All interfaces, annotations and types contained within the following packages are not supported:

* `javax.ws.rs.client`
* `javax.ws.rs.container`
* `javax.ws.rs.ext`

==== Supported Annotations

Micronaut JAX-RS works by converting (at compilation time) a JAX-RS annotation definition into the equivalent Micronaut version.

==== Injectable Parameter Types

In addition to the supported JAX-RS annotations you can use the following JAX-RS types as parameter types to resources or client definitions:

* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/HttpHeaders.html[javax.ws.rs.core.HttpHeaders]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/CacheControl.html[javax.ws.rs.core.CacheControl]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/Cookie.html[javax.ws.rs.core.Cookie]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/EntityTag.html[javax.ws.rs.core.EntityTag]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/Link.html[javax.ws.rs.core.Link]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/MediaType.html[javax.ws.rs.core.MediaType]

You can also use the link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/Context.html[@Context] annotation to inject any bean into a resource type's method parameter.

NOTE: Parameter binding to constructor argument of resource types is not supported at this time.

==== Supported Return Types

You can also use the following return types from the JAX-RS API in your resource classes:

* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/Response.html[javax.ws.rs.core.Response]
* link:{jaxrsapi}/javax/ws/rs/core/StreamingOutput.html[javax.ws.rs.core.StreamingOutput]
